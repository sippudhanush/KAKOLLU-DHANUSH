Stress detection on social media poses a unique set of challenges due to the diverse 
ways individuals express themselves online. The sheer volume of data, coupled with 
the nuanced nature of language, necessitates sophisticated tools for accurate 
identification of stress indicators. The crux of the problem lies in developing a machine 
learning model that can navigate the intricacies of language, context, and individual 
expression to reliably detect signs of stress in social media posts. 
Furthermore, the impact of stress on individuals' lives is multifaceted, making its 
detection even more challenging. Users may not explicitly state their emotional state, 
and stress indicators can manifest in various linguistic forms, including subtle nuances 
and implicit expressions. 
This project aims to explore the potential of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and 
Machine Learning (ML) for detecting stress from social media posts. NLP techniques 
can be used to analyze the language used in social media posts, such as the chosen 
words, the sentence structure, and the use of emojis. ML algorithms can then be trained 
on this data to learn to identify patterns that are indicative of stress.
